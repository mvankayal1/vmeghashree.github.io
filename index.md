## Key Projects

### 1. Knowledge Graph-Powered Intelligent Document Processing
*   **Role:** AI & Data Analyst at AttainX, Inc.
*   **Description:** Developed an intelligent system to process diverse documents (PDFs, logs). I built a Knowledge Graph and used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs, which improved query accuracy by 25%. Also engineered an automated ETL pipeline that sped up data analysis by 30%.
*   **Technologies:** Python, PySpark, Neo4j, LangChain, RAG, Hugging Face Transformers, AWS.

### 2. Analysis of LinkedIn Job Postings Data
*   **Role:** Research at Binghamton University
*   **Description:** Designed a data-driven recommendation system to match candidate profiles with job requirements from LinkedIn. I visualized job market trends and derived insights into salary dynamics to help job seekers.
*   **Technologies:** Python, MongoDB, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 3. Training ML Agents in UNITY to Detect Explosives
*   **Role:** Research at Vellore Institute of Technology
*   **Description:** Developed and trained AI agents in a simulated 3D Unity environment to detect explosives. I used reinforcement learning (PPO and SAC algorithms) to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.
*   **Technologies:** Unity, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning.
